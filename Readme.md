### Dependencies
* *mips-linux-gnu binutils: You may be able to just download this via your package manager (`sudo apt install binutils-mips-linux-gnu`), or you'll have to build it yourself. (guide todo)


#### Ubuntu and co (easy mode):
For a quick and easy way to install all relevant decomp-related tools on Ubuntu and other similar distros, 
```
sudo apt install -y binutils-mips-linux-gnu build-essential pkg-config python3 python3-pip wget git clang-tidy clang-format nano vbindiff zlib1g-dev libyaml-dev libcapstone-dev
```

### Make
run `make` to rebuild the rom. Get `OK`? If so, you're all set! Otherwise, please feel free to reach out to us in the discord.
Use `PM_HEADER_REBUILD=1 make` to rebuild C sources when any header files change.
